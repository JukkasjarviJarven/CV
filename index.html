        <h3>Jacob Ruokojärvi</h3>
        <h4>Who am I?</h4>
        <h6>
            <p>I started my life as a very driven little child, for example; When my father got me a dirtbike I wanted to
            drive it by myself for weeks but my father would not allow me to do so until I learned to ride the bicycle
            without supportive wheels. It took a few days to learn how to ride the bicycle because I was very naive at
            the time and did not accept any advice from my dad. I fell over a lot but I learned to ride it by sheer will
            and dedication. I think that event set a mark on my character ever since. I am driven, methodical, focused
            and work fast, at least faster than I did back then.
            </p>

            <p>This interest in technology started when I was about 7 or 8 and would sit at my dad’s computer doing all
            kinds of technological activities. I would watch him closely when he plugged in my playstation in the TV and
            when he fixed all appliances around the house, soon enough I overtook him as the “tech-guy” in the
            household. Whenever there is a problem with technology or wiring at home I am quick to assist and I do it
            without complaint seeing as I just love doing it!
            </p>

            <p>I am used to getting over the problems that form everyday, my goal is to make this world a better place
            through technology and of course to make sure my future is set. The prefered way of doing this is to simply
            help develop the frontier of new technology being processed.
            </p>

            <p>I would be perfect for this school as I ,as said before, am very driven and further on I have an excellent
            memory and I have quite the imagination when it comes to inventing new applications and appliances for daily
            use.
            </p>
            <h7>So, Why choose me?</h7>
            <p>I usually do not have much to do so whenever I have some free time between studying and working I tend to
            write some more on the codes I have as a hobby and find different ways to work with the codelines I create.
            It would be exciting if I were to be granted a spot at this school as I think I will be a driving force in
            the class I end up in.
            </p>
